I be trained in hit-and-run pillaging and be the deadliest with a pistol of all the captains on the high seas. Ye be nothing to me but another source o’ swag.",

    "I’ll have yer guts for garters and keel haul ye like never been done before, hear me true. You think ye can hide behind your newfangled computing device?",

    "If only ye had had the foresight to know what devilish wrath your jibe was about to incur, ye might have belayed the comment.",

    "But ye couldn’t, ye didn’t, and now ye’ll pay the ultimate toll, you buffoon. I’ll poop fury all over ye and ye’ll drown in the depths o’ it. You’re fish food now."
